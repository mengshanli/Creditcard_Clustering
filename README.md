# Creditcard_Clustering

## Objective
Develop a credit card customer segmentation to define marketing strategy.

## Outline
### Preprocessing
* Missing Values Treatment
* Feature Distribution - KDE plot
* Outliers Treatment
* Correlation Matrix
* Create Interaction Features
* Feature Digitization

### Modeling
* Evaluation Metric - Silhouette Score
* Model - KMeans

### Visualization
* Line Plot - Silhouette Score under Various Number of Cluster
* Scatter Plot - Cluster Results
* Histogram - Features Value of Each Cluster
* Render Plot - Features Value of Each Cluster

## Features of customers in each group
